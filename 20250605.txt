🔸 today's plan :
    decided learning php, html, css... with making website by a playlist youtube '생활코딩 web1'

🔸 what i did :
    made a folder 'web' and coded for a website.

❗ opeing 1.html on web : 
    drag 1.html from EXPLORER in vscode to web. or press ctrl + o in web and search 1.html.

🔸 what i did : 
    lernt some grammatics of HTML. It took 2,5 hours. lecture 1 to 13.
    I think I did less then the half of whole vidoes in playlist.
    But solo-learning can give me less inspiration. and with this playlist made fun.😊
    at least finish this lecture with this playlist and then let's see.

❗ next time : lecture 14
❗ mysteps : do HTML and then CSS,PHP -> PHP framework(library) -> Bigdata?
