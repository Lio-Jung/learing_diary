🔸 🔹 ❗ ❓(memo tools)

🔸today's plan : 
the scaling and Position Problem --> was not a problem... other thing was problem...

🔸what i did : 
2std
	compared 2 mothodes(calcViewMatrixx from ExporterPDF and calcViewMatrix from ExporterPdeWoFIV)
	thought the code how to make scale and position right.
	using 'debug.writeline("");' found which methode is called with which mount of polygons.
	-> found the problem : need new Viewmode and need to put it in a methode.
	
❗ next time :
View.cs
	learn ' ViewMode.Ebene' or make a new 'ViewMode.WatchingView' and then put the correct view in methode.
